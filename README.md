# thsensor
Temperature and humidity sensor based on Adafruit Huzzah (esp8266) sending data to ThingSpeak cloud.

(Do not look at this project just yet! It is nothing but a bunch of files -- at this stage of development, it is unlikely to be useful for anyone.

Files and folders:
* sketch_schematic.fzz -- Fritzig diagram of the sensor shematic
* sketch_code -- Arduino IDE project containig the sketch source code

Planned:
* andoid_setup_app -- Android app that can be used to initialize a sensor
